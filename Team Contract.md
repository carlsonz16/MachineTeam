## Project Description

We are Team Machine and for our Senior Design project, we want to create some sort of machine learning project. We want to use Python for our project and try to incorporate machine learning in some aspects. We plan to meet every week for at least 2 hours. Depending on people’s schedules, that could change the days of the week and could also have the meetings spread out over multiple days. We will all be in charge of researching how to get started with machine learning and some applications we could try and create using it. Once we figure out the specific thing that we want to do with machine learning we will each have the responsibilities of coding and continuing research. 

We have a couple of ideas for specific projects that we would like to explore. One of the ideas is that we use machine learning to analyze sports data and then try to use that data and algorithms to predict the outcomes of sports games. Another idea that we had was to explore news titles and have the machine compare those news titles to the price of stocks during that news article's time and see if it can predict future stock prices. Lastly, we thought about implementing machine learning AI in a video game that we want to make super intelligent.
