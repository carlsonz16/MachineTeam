### Project Abstract
The sports betting market has seen rapid expansion due to the increased legalization of betting in multiple regions. This growth has been fueled by the emergence of online platforms, advanced technologies, and the widespread adoption of mobile betting applications. Leveraging algorithms that incorporate data from credible sources, sports betting websites provide users with a competitive edge. This approach facilitates well-informed betting decisions based on reliable information, leading to heightened prediction accuracy, increased success rates, and potentially greater profits. Furthermore, the use of trustworthy sources ensures data reliability, fostering user trust and transparency. Consequently, this integration of advanced algorithms and credible data contributes to a more sophisticated and reliable betting experience for enthusiasts.


## Project Description
Our project aims to delve deep into the realm of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence using Python. Our primary objective is to create a machine-learned model that can analyze sports statistics and generate predictions. These predictions will be utilized to develop a website where users can retrieve these predictions to influence future bets. The project emphasizes both achieving practical results and the educational journey of gaining a comprehensive understanding of Machine Learning and AI.


## User Stories and Design Diagrams
### User Stories 
- As a user, I want to be able to get accurate stats and predictions of players I wish to bet on.
- As a user, I want to see the created Artificial Intelligence preform a desired task, so that I can gauge the progress of the AI.
- As a user, I want to be able to place bets that have high percentage chance of winning.
- As a user, I want to be able to see what bets are the best bang for my buck so that I have a high probability of making money.

**D0:**
*The basic overview of the system includes input using an undefined data source of sports statistics, 
training a ML model, and outputting the results to our web UI.*

**D1:**
*D0 is expanded upon by defining multiple statistics sources as well as introducing a data preprocessing 
phase. To expand on the ML model, the test dataset is introduced which we will use to prove the validity 
of the model. We also introduce some of the possible web components we can create to allow users to 
view results easily.*

**D2:**
*We again expand on D1 by specifically defining where the statistics could possibly come from, including 
known APIs as well as web scraping. The data preprocessing step is split to a data cleaning and then a 
data splitting phase, which will be used to generate the test dataset. The test dataset will be used to 
make sure the model is providing results up to our standard. After the data is serialized for storage and is sent to the database as well as our web components, which we currently assume we will use React*
