# Task List

1. Research the current state of sports prediction methodologies and tools.
2. Research the use of Unity Machine Learning with Python.
3. Specify the sports events we would like to focus on.
4. Investigate potential datasets and APIs related to our selected sports events.
5. Design an initial model architecture for the sports predictions.
6. Develop a prototype model using relevant ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.)
7. Develop and conduct tests for the model to gauge performance, both back and forward testing, to refine the model.
8. Develop a schema to store data used for our model efficiently.
9. Design the web app UI/UX and decide on a framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.).
10. Develop the necessary front-end components for the website.
11. Integrate the ML model into the site's backend to display predictions (Flask, Django etc.)
12. Implement any needed database solutions, if any.
13. Document program architecture.
14. Document machine learning model specifics.
15. Document data pipeline specifics.
16. Document front-end component specifics.
17. Develop and run tests for the web application to ensure we are alerted when functionalities break.
18. Configure recovery solutions for site downtime. 
19. Refine the UI/UX based on user feedback.
20. Deploy the web app to a suitable hosting platform/service.
