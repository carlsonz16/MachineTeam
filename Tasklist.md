# Task List

1. Research the current state of sports prediction methodologies and tools.
2. Research the use of Unity Machine Learning with Python. ***- Sean***
3. Specify the sports events we would like to focus on. ***- Zach***
4. Investigate potential datasets and APIs related to our selected sports events.  ***- Zach, Sean***
5. Collect data for past games, including features like teams, players, scores, and other relevant statistics. ***- Zach, Sean***
6. Design an initial model architecture for the sports predictions. ***- All members***
7. Develop a prototype model using relevant ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.) ***- Zach***
8. Develop and conduct tests for the model to gauge performance, both back and forward testing, to refine the model. ***- Zach***
9. Develop a schema to store data used for our model efficiently. ***- All members***
10. Design the web app UI/UX and decide on a framework (React, Vue, Angular, etc.). ***- All members***
12. Develop the necessary front-end components for the website.***- All members***
13. Integrate the ML model into the site's backend to display predictions (Flask, Django etc.)  ***- Zach***
14. Create meaningful features that can contribute to prediction accuracy (e.g., team rankings, player statistics). ***- All members***
15. Implement any needed database solutions, if any. ***- All members***
16. Document program architecture (including machine learning model specifics and data pipeline specifics). ***- Rylee***
17. Write comprehensive front-end and developer documentation. ***- Rylee***
18. Develop and run tests for the web application to ensure we are alerted when functionalities break. ***- Zach***
21. Configure recovery solutions for site downtime. 
22. Refine the UI/UX based on user feedback. ***- Sean***
