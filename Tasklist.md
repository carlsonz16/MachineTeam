# Task List

1. Research the current state of sports prediction methodologies and tools.
2. Specify the events we would like to focus on.
3. Investigate potential datasets and APIs related to our selected sports events.
4. Design an initial model architecture for the sports predictions.
5. Develop prototype model using relevant ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.)
6. Develop and conduct tests for the model to guage performance, both back and forward testing, to refine the model.
7. Develop a schema to efficiently store data used for our model.
8. Design the web app UI/UX and decide on a framework to use (React, Vue, Angular, etc.).
9. Develop the necessary front-end components for the website.
10. Integrate the ML model into the site's backend to display predictions (Flask, Django etc.)
11. Implement any needed database solutions if any.
12. Document architecture, ML model specifics, data pipeline specifics, and front-end component specifics.
13. Develop and run tests for the web application to ensure we are alerted when functionalities break.
14. Configure recovery solutions for site downtime. 
15. Refine the UI/UX based on user feedback.
16. Deploy the web app to a suitable hosting platform/service.
