# Self Assessment

## Part A
During this project, my individual contribution primarily focused on the frontend development aspects. I conducted research into various methodologies and tools commonly used in sports prediction, particularly those tailored to NBA game prediction. This involved exploring different APIs that provided historical data on NBA games, spending around 2 hours on this task. Subsequently, I played a key role in designing the user interface and user experience for the web application. After selecting React as our frontend framework, I invested significant time, approximately 7 hours, in researching React and complementary tools such as Tailwind CSS and Material UI to enhance our development process. Additionally, I spent 10 hours developing frontend components for essential pages like Home, About, and PlayerStats, configuring the webpage's design using MaterialWinds CSS add-ins.

Throughout this process, I built upon the skills identified in my initial assessment from last Fall. By actively engaging in frontend development tasks, I honed my proficiency in React and expanded my knowledge of frontend frameworks and libraries. Additionally, integrating the Historical Data API into our application not only improved my technical skills but also enhanced my understanding of data integration processes. Despite facing obstacles such as time constraints and the complexities of integrating external APIs, my successes included effectively contributing to the frontend development, conducting thorough research, and actively participating in team meetings, accumulating to a total of 28 hours. Overall, this project provided valuable learning experiences and helped me develop competencies in frontend development, research, and collaborative teamwork.

## Part B
As a group, we accomplished several significant milestones throughout the project. We successfully researched and implemented various methodologies and tools relevant to NBA game prediction, integrating historical data APIs into our web application. Additionally, we designed and developed an intuitive user interface using React and other frontend technologies, ensuring a smooth user experience across different pages. Our collaboration during weekly team meetings was crucial in coordinating our efforts, addressing challenges, and making decisions collectively. However, there were instances where communication breakdowns hindered our progress, leading to delays in task completion and confusion regarding project objectives. Despite these challenges, our group remained resilient, adapting to changes and supporting each other to overcome obstacles.

Throughout our teamwork, I learned the importance of effective communication and collaboration in achieving project goals. Clear communication channels facilitated the exchange of ideas and ensured everyone stayed informed about project updates and task assignments. However, I also learned that maintaining consistent communication requires effort from all team members and necessitates regular check-ins to address any issues promptly. While our group faced obstacles and setbacks, our collective determination and willingness to support one another ultimately led to the project's successful completion. Each team member contributed their unique skills and perspectives, and special recognition is deserved by those who consistently went above and beyond to ensure project success.
