# Week 3 - Part #2 Individual Capstone Assessment
Rylee Charlton - Machine Team

Our team, the Machine Team, has decided to work on a machine learning project for our senior design project. While our exact project scope is still taking shape, our primary programming language of choice will be Python. Among our potential project directions, one concept involves using machine learning to analyze sports data. We would incorporate different algorithms to predict the outcomes of a sports game. Additionally, we've contemplated another intriguing possibility: using natural language processing to sift through news articles and use the extracted insights to predict future stock prices for specific companies. This exciting endeavor represents our commitment to pushing the boundaries of machine learning applications.

The curriculum at UC has unquestionably influenced our decision on our project topic and will assist us in completing this project. Throughout my academic journey here, I've witnessed significant growth in my problem-solving abilities, owing much of this improvement to the coursework. Notably, ENED 1100 and ENED 1120 stand out as exceptional classes that have boosted my confidence in group dynamics. My interest in Machine Learning started to bloom once we began to take CS4071 (D & A OF ALGORITHMS) and CS4033 (AI PRINCIPLES AND APPLICATIONS). These courses have played a pivotal role in steering our project toward the fascinating realm of machine learning.


During my journey here at UC, I had the privilege of participating in a program that mandated co-op experiences as an integral part of our degree. My initial co-op experience was substituted with an Experiential Education Program (EEP), during which I earned multiple LinkedIn Learning certificates in Project Management Techniques. This EEP exposed me to various methodologies, such as Agile, which will undoubtedly enhance our team's ability to achieve our project objectives successfully. Subsequently, I dedicated several co-op semesters to working with Schneider Downs, a prominent tax company in Pittsburgh. Throughout seven semesters, I was part of the Network/Security team, allowing me to work part-time during the academic year. My time at Schneider Downs involved close collaboration within a tight-knit team on numerous projects, honing my ability to seamlessly work with groups. These collective experiences have enriched my skill set and prepared me for the challenges our senior project will bring.

I am highly motivated and excited to participate in this project because it represents a unique opportunity to apply my knowledge and skills in a real-world setting. Moreover, the collaborative nature of this project within the Machine Team fosters a dynamic learning environment where I can share ideas, learn from peers, and collectively strive for innovative solutions. 

Our premilary approach to design a robust solution includes conducting research to gather insights on existing machine-learning techniques applicable to either sports data analysis/stock price prediction. From our research, we will then define a specific project scope. We will also be required to collect relevant data, fine-tune our program, and implement some sort of user interface. Finally, we will have to test and validate our program to continue to refine it and increase the accuracy of our predictions. Our expected outcome is developing a Python-based application capable of analyzing sports data and providing accurate game outcome predictions (or stock price predictions). I hope to enhance my proficiency in machine learning, data preprocessing, and algorithm optimization during this Design Project. The ultimate gauge of success is effective collaboration, and quality of code and documentation.
