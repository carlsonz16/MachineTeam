# Week 3 - Part #2 Individual Capstone Assessment
## Jake D'Amico - Machine Team

Our team has decided to utilize machine learning and python to develop some sort of application, but mostly focus on the research behind the topics. Our collective aim is not merely to produce a final project, the specifics of which are currently under deliberation, but to delve deeply into the intricacies and methodologies of machine learning. There are of course many frameworks that can be implemented with Python to solve machine learning problems at a very top level but that is less of what we are after. We'd like to have a deep understanding of how these systems work as well as the problems they can be used to solve. This of course involves both research as well as hands-on work for developing our project but it is certainly an excellent opportunity for growth in a topic that we don't have tons of experience with.

Of course, my time with UC will have a major impact in the design and execution of this project. We have had a fair share of courses diving specifically into related topics such as D&A of Algorithms, AI Principles, as well as our Python courses. However, I really think it is a combination of all of the classes that allows us to pursue a topic like this, not only ones specifically related to this project. Moreover, integrating knowledge from diverse courses gives our approach a holistic edge. Going deeper than the top-level of machine learning requires a confident understanding of many CS concepts and I definitely think UC has allowed us to do that, as well as the problem solving practice and thought pattern development we gained from our time here.

As well as the courses taken during my time at UC, my co-op experiences have had a very significant role in my development with CS and will certainly play a role during this project. I worked with Siemens all of my semesters developing the Solutionlink site. I took on multiple challenges during my time there in the fields of front-end development, back-end development, as well as performance tests for the site. It was a fantastic experience and gave me a great foundation to build off of with web development, something that not covered much at UC. I also gained many other different great soft skills that will translate great to my senior design project. Additionally, the collaborative environment at Siemens, along with the diverse challenges I encountered, honed my ability to approach problems from different angles and to work effectively within a team. These soft skills, combined with the technical expertise I cultivated with both Siemens and UC, will be invaluable in ensuring the success of our senior design project and fostering a productive group dynamic.

My motivation to dive into Python-driven machine learning for our senior design project comes from multiple places. On one hand, Python has many well documented frameworks for machine learning. We of course want the knowledge to apply these tools. Yet, instead of skimming the surface, we want to gain an intimate understanding of the underlying mechanics and potentials of these systems. From our academic foundation at UC and my hands-on experiences at Siemens, we believe we can push beyond conventional uses. Combining classroom knowledge with real-world application equips us with a unique vantage point. Ultimately, this project is not just about development, but about cultivating a deeper comprehension in an area where we are eager to expand our expertise. 

In our preliminary approach to designing a solution, we intend to start with an extensive research phase, focusing on widely recognized tools like Scikit, Pandas, and TensorFlow. By understanding their capabilities, we can better find where our project can add value. As for expected results, we anticipate a much deeper comprehension of machine learning concepts, combined with a working application or system that embodies our learnings. To self-evaluate, we'll be setting milestones for both our research and development phases and assess our progress with these benchmarks. Success will be a blend of achieving these milestones and realizing a project that integrates our academic knowledge with practical application.
