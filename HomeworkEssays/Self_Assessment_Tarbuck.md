# **Self Assessment**

## Part A
For our senior design project, my primary focus lied in two specific areas: weekly assignments and front-end design/development. More specifically, for the front-end design/development, in order to accomplish an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for Precise Picks, 
I leveraged Tailwind â€˜s utility-first approach to rapidly prototype and style various components. I was able to efficiently customize the appearance of elements, from buttons, forms, and layout grids, without the need for writing custom CSS. In conjunction with Tailwind, React 
served as the backbone of Precise Picks front-end architecture. I utilized React's component-based structure to break down complex UI elements into reusable and manage units. This enabled seamless integrations with our projects backend logic and enabled dynamic data rendering, 
enhancing the overall interactivity, and responsiveness of the website. Additionally, I took on the responsibility of managing various weekly project tasks, including drafting project descriptions, presentations, user stories, etc. This allowed me to hone project management, communication, 
and collaboration within our team.

Reflecting on my initial assessment from last fall, I can confidently say that I applied and built upon the identified skills throughout this project. Not only did I deepen my technical expertise in UI development, but I also cultivated essential competencies such as teamwork, adaptability, 
and problem-solving. Despite facing challenges along the way, I successfully navigated through them by leveraging the support of my team. Overall, this project provided me with valuable experiences and opportunities for growth, both personally and professionally.

## Part B
As a team, we successfully were able to develop/design a locally hosted website called Precise Picks. Precise Picks leveraged machine learning and AI to provide result predictions for both upcoming and live NBA games. Additionally, we also offered specific player stats, money-line odds, and more. 
By leveraging each member's unique skills and expertise, we were able to efficiently tackle various project tasks, from conceptualization and design to implementation and testing. One of the key aspects of our success lies within effective communication and collaboration. Our team's regular/weekly 
meetings and clear delegation of responsibilities played a critical role in ensuring the completion/success of Precise Picks. 

Personally, I can't state aspects of our teamwork that were not successful. In terms of overall effort, I think contributions were equal. I know that specifically Zach and Jacob put significant effort when overcoming the difficulties and challenges when training the models. 
While each of us contributed to the project in different ways, I believe that every team member deserves special recognition for their contributions and effort to the project. I think that we worked seamlessly together as a team to successfully accomplish an amazing senior design project.
