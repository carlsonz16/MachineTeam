## Project Description
Our primary goal is to dive deep into the realm of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence using the Python programming language. This project is not just about achieving a specific solution but is also focused on the learning journey itself, allowing us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the subject and practical application of it. We want this project to have a machine learned model that can take in sports statistics and output predicted statistics so that users are able to place calculated sports bets on the results.
